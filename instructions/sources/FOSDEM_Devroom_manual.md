# FOSDEM A/V devroom manager manual
## Where to get help

* On Matrix: `#video:fosdem.org`. When using matrix, always mention your room name. Best way is to change your nick name in the room by typing `/myroomnick [ROOM] your_nick_name`
	* Please use the actual room number, not the devroom name/topic.
* In person: there is a per-building team in every building, together with FIT or NOC (AW.1125, H.2111, UB4.228, UD2.119)
* For core issues, the NOC/VOC is in K at the end of corridor in front of K.1.105. Please come to that room only for emergencies.
* Emergency: Vasil Kolev on `+359888508044` or Mark Van den Borre on `+32486961726`.

The best way would be to ask in the matrix chat, someone will respond shortly and see if people need to be dispatched your way.

## Remote questions

There is a chatroom in Matrix for your devroom, in which people can see the live stream of the talk and add questions. The room is named after the devroom (not the physical room).

If you have your Matrix ID in pretalx, you'll be pulled directly. If you have any issues with this, ask questions in the devroom managers' Matrix room.

## Starting a presentation

* Connect the speaker's laptop to the HDMI in port of the video box. If the speaker has only VGA out, a limited number of VGA to HDMI adapters are available with the per-building video support team.
	* Make sure that the video box displays the screen of the laptop on its display. The output there is delayed by ~5 seconds.
* Make the speaker wear the microphone. Here are some guidelines:
	* The microphone is attached to speaker's clothes, close to the neck, under the chin in the middle of the torso;
	* Ensure no necklaces, lanyards, scarves, beards or other objects that could touch the microphone during the talk;
	* If there is no suitable place to attach the microphone, a lanyard could be used for this purpose;
	* The microphone receiver is attached to the belt of the speaker. If this is not possible, attach it to their pocket;
* **Make sure the microphone is turned on** and **not muted**. The audio levels can be checked on the camera and should be audible in the room.

## Video mixing control

In `https://pretalx.fosdem.org` you can find the link to control the video mix. If needed, share that link with the volunteer(s) that help you.

The interface is pretty self-explanatory (and usable even on a mobile phone). You can see the current output, the camera and presenter box sources, and select one of four different views that will go on the stream and be recorded:

* Picture-in-picture - big presentation, small camera view (this is the default), or swapped
* Full-screen - camera or presentation

If you don't want to deal with this, leave it at the default. This should be fine for most of the presentations.

If you want to make the most of it, these are a few guidelines:

* Use "full-screen - camera" for the intro and Q&A
* Use "Picture-in-picture - big camera view, small presentation" for most of the presentation
* Use "full-screen - presentation" for demonstrations or slides with a lot of small text

Be aware that whatever you choose to do will also end up in the final recordings. What is streamed is recorded. We will not re-mix videos after the conference.

## Review

`https://review.video.fosdem.org` is for preparing the finished videos.

* All speakers will receive a link for reviewing their video.
	* As a devroom manager, you'll be on CC: for such emails.
* The video team in your building may be able to help you with this, depending on their workload.
* Contact: the video mailing list <video@fosdem.org>.

## Misc

Because most rooms cannot have a dedicated volunteer to manage the camera and follow the speaker around, we recommend taping two stripes of duct tape or similar on the floor to mark the end of the camera's field of vision and notifying the speakers to keep in that area. The video team will prepare those for the rooms where those could be needed.
